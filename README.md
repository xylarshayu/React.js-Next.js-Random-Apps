# React.js-Next.js-Random-Apps
This is a repository with sub-modules of some React.js/Next.js/Vite apps I've built.

They are typically small explorations or assignments for a learning platform called Crio.Do.
Therefore, a lot of them were made on a different [Github account](https://github.com/xshayu), though I figured I'd create a parent repo with them as sub-repos.

Their complexity varies wildly. On all of them (with an exception or two) I've used TypeScript.

As of right now (8 Jan 2025) the most complex ones are:
